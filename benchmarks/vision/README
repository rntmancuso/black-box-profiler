Modified surce-tree of SD-VBS benchmarks to test the BU BlackBox Profiler.
The following changes compared to the original tree have been performed:

1. Main computation payload functions have been aggregated within a single function;

2. The symbol name of the main payload function is reported in the corresponding prof_symbol.txt file;

3. Compilation flag -static has been added as a default for all the benchmarks;

4. Alternative inputs have been added for benchmarks disparity, mser, stitch, and tracking.


Please refer to SD-VBS.pdf or SD-VBS.doc for information about the original SD-VBS benchmarks.
